    <p>Because technology moves fast, it’s easy to feel left behind.
        An old version of a JavaScript library is making your application perform slowly. 
        You spend most of your time patching old code. 
        Your UI looks like it was created years ago, but you don’t have time to update it.</p>
    
    <p>Our team recently faced all these challenges when our 10-year-old 
        product was using an old version of the Dojo toolkit. To migrate to 
        the latest version of Dojo, we needed to rewrite the whole code with an asynchronous model. 
        Our solution also needed to improve performance and provide a rich
         UI experience that complies with the IBM Carbon theme.</p>
